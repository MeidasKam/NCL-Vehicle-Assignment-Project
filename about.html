            <p class="aboutemployee"> 
              Scott Kendal or Scotty as he is often referred began his sales career at Lings  at the turn of the Millennium. Before studying Business at London College of Hamilton, Scott was a personal trainer, which he still dabbles in, to this day. Scotty then changed gears to the banking industry in 1995 with Halifax Trust in Brantford. Here he started to develop his “Customers First” approach with his clients. It was not exactly a “natural” transition from his previous careers to automotive sales, but after a couple of his clients at the bank encouraged him to apply for a sales position, he made the move and hasn’t looked back.
              Scotty is certified by Lings as a Certified Used Car Vehicle professional and is the recipient of several Car Salesman awards. Although his specialty is in leasing and maintaining customer loyalty, he is never too busy to look after new customers and always appreciates the many referrals. Scott believes that the car buying experience should be made easy, transparent and enjoyable. Scotty’s customers appreciate the no nonsense approach he takes with them.
              Away from the dealership Scotty can be found golfing, hiking, mountain biking, various motorsports and spending time with his wife and dogs in Northumberland.
