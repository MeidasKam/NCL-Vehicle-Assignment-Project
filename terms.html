<h3 class="read">Basis of sale</h3>
<b class="readbody">17. The description of the Goods in our website does not constitute a contractual offer to sell the Goods. When an Order 
has been submitted on the Website, we can reject it for any reason, although we will try to tell you the reason without 
delay.
<br>

the Order. It is your responsibility to check that you have used the ordering process correctly.
<br>
19. A Contract will be formed for the sale of Goods ordered only when you receive an email from us confirming the Order 
(Order Confirmation). You must ensure that the Order Confirmation is complete and accurate and inform us 
immediately of any errors. We are not responsible for any inaccuracies in the Order placed by you. By placing an Order 
you agree to us giving you confirmation of the Contract by means of an email with all information in it (ie the Order 
Confirmation). You will receive the Order Confirmation within a reasonable time after making the Contract, but in any 
event not later than the delivery of any Goods supplied under the Contract.

entered into unless the variation is agreed by the Customer and the Supplier in writing.
<br>
22. We intend that these Terms and Conditions apply only to a Contract entered into by you as a Consumer. If this is not 
the case, you must tell us, so that we can provide you with a different contract with terms which are more appropriate 
for you and which might, in some respects, be better for you, eg by giving you rights as a business.
</b>

<br>
25. You must pay by submitting your credit or debit card details with your Order and we can take payment immediately or

</b>
<h3 class="read">Delivery</h3>
<b class="readbody">26. We will deliver the Goods, to the Delivery Location by the time or within the agreed period or, failing any agreement, 
  without undue delay and, in any event, not more than 30 days after the day on which the Contract is entered into.
  <br>
  27. In any case, regardless of events beyond our control, if we do not deliver the Goods on time, you can (in addition to 
any other remedies) treat the Contract at an end if:
a. we have refused to deliver the Goods, or if delivery on time is essential taking into account all the relevant 
circumstances at the time the Contract was made, or you said to us before the Contract was made that delivery on 
time was essential; or
b. after we have failed to deliver on time, you have specified a later period which is appropriate to the circumstances 
and we have not delivered within that period.
<br>
28. If you treat the Contract at an end, we will (in addition to other remedies) promptly return all payments made under the 
Contract.
<br>
29. If you were entitled to treat the Contract at an end, but do not do so, you are not prevented from cancelling the Order 
for any Goods or rejecting Goods that have been delivered and, if you do this, we will (in addition to other remedies) without delay return all payments made under the Contract for any such cancelled or rejected Goods. If the Goods have 
been delivered, you must return them to us or allow us to collect them from you and we will pay the costs of this.
<br>
30. If any Goods form a commercial unit (a unit is a commercial unit if division of the unit would materially impair the 
value of the goods or the character of the unit) you cannot cancel or reject the Order for some of those Goods without 
also cancelling or rejecting the Order for the rest of them.
<br>
31. We do not generally deliver to addresses outside England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and 
Channels Islands. If, however, we accept an Order for delivery outside that area, you may need to pay import duties or 
other taxes, as we will not pay them.
<br>
32. You agree we may deliver the Goods in instalments if we suffer a shortage of stock or other genuine and fair reason, 
subject to the above provisions and provided you are not liable for extra charges.
<br>
33. If you or your nominee fail, through no fault of ours, to take delivery of the Goods at the Delivery Location, we may 
charge the reasonable costs of storing and redelivering them.
<br>
34. The Goods will become your responsibility from the completion of delivery or Customer collection. You must, if 
reasonably practicable, examine the Goods before accepting them.
  </b>
<h3 class="read">Risk and Title</h3>
<b class="readbody">35. Risk of damage to, or loss of, any Goods will pass to you when the Goods are delivered to you.
  <br>
  36. You do not own the Goods until we have received payment in full. If full payment is overdue or a step occurs towards 
your bankruptcy, we can choose, by notice to cancel any delivery and end any right to use the Goods still owned by 
you, in which case you must return them or allow us to collect them.
</b>
<h3 class="read">Withdrawl and cancellation</h3>
<b class="readbody">37. You can withdraw the Order by telling us before the Contract is made, if you simply wish to change your mind and 
  without giving us a reason, and without incurring any liability.
<br>
38. You can cancel the Contract except for any Goods which are made to your special requirements (the Returns Right) 
by telling us no later than 7 calendar days from the day the Contract was entered into, if you simply wish to change 
your mind and without giving us a reason, and without liability, except in that case, you must return to any of our 
business premises the Goods in undamaged condition at your own expense. Then we must without delay refund to you 
the price for those Goods which have been paid for in advance, but we can retain any separate delivery charge. This 
does not affect your rights when the reason for the cancellation is any defective Goods. This Returns Right is different 
and separate from the Cancellation Rights below.
<br>
39. This is a distance contract (as defined below) which has the cancellation rights (Cancellation Rights) set out below. 
These Cancellation Rights, however, do not apply, to a contract for the following goods (with no others) in the 
following circumstances:
a. goods that are made to your specifications or are clearly personalised;
b. goods which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.
<br>
40. Also, the Cancellation Rights for a Contract cease to be available in the following circumstances:
a. in the case of any sales contract, if the goods become mixed inseparably (according to their nature) with other 
items after delivery.
<h5 class="read">Right to cancel</h5>
<br>
41. Subject as stated in these Terms and Conditions, you can cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.
<br>
42. The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party, other than the 
carrier indicated by you, acquires physical possession of the last of the Goods. In a contract for the supply of goods 
over time (ie subscriptions), the right to cancel will be 14 days after the first delivery.
<br>
43. To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this Contract by a clear statement setting 
out your decision (eg a letter sent by post or email). You can use the attached model cancellation form, but it is not 
obligatory. In any event, you must be able to show clear evidence of when the cancellation was made, so you may 
decide to use the model cancellation form.
<br>
44. You can also electronically fill in and submit the model cancellation form or any other clear statement of the 
Customer's decision to cancel the Contract on our website file:///D:/1.%20Web%20assingment/Latest%20version%
205.0/index.html. If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a 
cancellation in a Durable Medium (eg by email) without delay.
<br>
45. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the 
right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.
<h5 class="read">Effects of cancellation in the cancellation period</h5>
46. Except as set out below, if you cancel this Contract, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you, 
including the costs of delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you chose a type of delivery other than the 
least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us).
<h5 class="read">Deduction for Goods supplied</h5>
47. We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any Goods supplied, if the loss is the result of 
unnecessary handling by you (ie handling the Goods beyond what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics 
and functioning of the Goods: eg it goes beyond the sort of handling that might be reasonably allowed in a shop). This 
is because you are liable for that loss and, if that deduction is not made, you must pay us the amount of that loss.
<h5 class="read">Timing of reimbursement</h5>
48. If we have not offered to collect the Goods, we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:
a. 4 days after the day we receive back from you any Goods supplied, or
b. (if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide evidence that you have sent back the Goods.
<br>
49. If we have offered to collect the Goods or if no Goods were supplied, we will make the reimbursement without undue 
delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this Contract.
<br>
50. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you 
have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.
<h5 class="read">Returning Goods</h5>
51. If you have received Goods in connection with the Contract which you have cancelled, you must send back the Goods 
or hand them over to us at 1 Wagon way, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE98 1TH, United Kingdom, NE98 1TH 
 without delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate to us your cancellation 
of this Contract. The deadline is met if you send back the Goods before the period of 14 days has expired. You agree 
that you will have to bear the cost of returning the Goods.
<br>
52. For the purposes of these Cancellation Rights, these words have the following meanings:
a. distance contract means a contract concluded between a trader and a consumer under an organised distance sales 
or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the 
exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication up to and including the time at which the contract 
is concluded;
b. sales contract means a contract under which a trader transfers or agrees to transfer the ownership of goods to a 
consumer and the consumer pays or agrees to pay the price, including any contract that has both goods and 
services as its object.
</b>
<h3 class="read">Conformity</h3>
<b class="readbody">53. We have a legal duty to supply the Goods in conformity with the Contract, and will not have conformed if it does not 
  meet the following obligation.
<br>
54. Upon delivery, the Goods will:
a. be of satisfactory quality;
b. be reasonably fit for any particular purpose for which you buy the Goods which, before the Contract is made, you 
made known to us (unless you do not actually rely, or it is unreasonable for you to rely, on our skill and judgment) 
and be fit for any purpose held out by us or set out in the Contract; and
c. conform to their description.
<br>
55. It is not a failure to conform if the failure has its origin in your materials.
</b>
<h3 class="read">Successors and our sub-contractors</h3>
<b class="readbody">56. Either party can transfer the benefit of this Contract to someone else, and will remain liable to the other for its 
  obligations under the Contract. The Supplier will be liable for the acts of any sub-contractors who it chooses to help 
  perform its duties.
</b>
<h3 class="read">Circumstances beyond the control of either party</h3>
<b class="readbody">57. In the event of any failure by a party because of something beyond its reasonable control:
  a. the party will advise the other party as soon as reasonably practicable; and
b. the party's obligations will be suspended so far as is reasonable, provided that that party will act reasonably, and 
the party will not be liable for any failure which it could not reasonably avoid, but this will not affect the 
Customer's above rights relating to delivery and any right to cancel, below.
</b>
<h3 class="read">Privacy</h3>
<b class="readbody">58. Your privacy is critical to us. We respect your privacy and comply with the General Data Protection Regulation with 
  regard to your personal information.

<h3 class="read">Excluding liability</h3>
<b class="readbody">63. The Supplier does not exclude liability for: (i) any fraudulent act or omission; or (ii) for death or personal injury 
  caused by negligence or breach of the Supplier's other legal obligations. Subject to this, the Supplier is not liable for (i) loss which was not reasonably foreseeable to both parties at the time when the Contract was made, or (ii) loss (eg loss 
  of profit) to the Customer's business, trade, craft or profession which would not be suffered by a Consumer - because 
  the Supplier believes the Customer is not buying the Goods wholly or mainly for its business, trade, craft or profession.
</b>
<h3 class="read">Governing law, jurisdiction and complaints</h3>
<b class="readbody">64. The Contract (including any non-contractual matters) is governed by the law of England and Wales.
